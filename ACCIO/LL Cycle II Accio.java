// Approach: Detect Loop using Floyd's Cycle detection algorithm and get 
// the pointer to a loop node where the fast and slow pointer met. Once they meet, 
// we will reset the slow back to head & start moving slow with 1X speed and fast 
// will carry on from where it was previously but with 1X speed. Once slow and fast 
// meet again we will return either slow or fast. Assume the distance from head to the 
// start of the loop is x1. The distance from the start of the loop to the point fast and 
// slow meet is x2. The distance from the point fast and slow meet to the start of the loop
// is x3. Distance moved by fast is x1 + x2 + x3 + x2. Distance moved by slow is x1 + x2. 
// Since, fast moves twice the distance of slow; x1 + x2 + x3 + x2 = 2 (x1 + x2). 
// On solving we get x1 = x3.

// Detect Loop using Floyd's Cycle detection algorithm and get the
// pointer to the loop node where the two pointers meet.
// Reset slow to head and move both pointers at the same speed.
// Return the node where the two pointers meet again.
// If loop does not exist return null.

// Time Complexity: O(N)

// Space Complexity: O(1)

// Below is the Java implementation of above idea:
